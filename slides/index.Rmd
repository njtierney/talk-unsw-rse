> The incentive structures of academic statistics still signal that mathematical statistics and the creation of new models and inferential procedures are more valuable than work related to data manipulation, visualisation, and programming. This is reflected in the content of for-credit courses, qualifying exams, and standards for funding and promotion.... It can be very difficult to  present modern data scientific work as impactful scholarly activity, when the system still  defines that primarily as theory and methodology papers.

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan

---

> The basic practices of modularity, testing, version control, packaging, 
and interface design are not mere niceties. They determine whether data scientific 
products can actually be trusted and built upon, like a proof in mathematics

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan

>  Users often remark on the ease of  manipulating data with dplyr and it is natural to wonder if perhaps the task itself is trivial.  We claim it is not. Many probability challenges become dramatically easier, once you strike  upon the “right” notation. In both cases, what feels like a matter of notation or syntax is  really a more about exploiting the “right” abstraction.

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan

---

>  It doesn’t matter how good a theoretical solution is, unless there are 
practical tools that implement it. We must also recognise that humans are an essential part 
of the data science process and study how they can interact with the computer most 
effectively. Finding useful abstractions and exposing them through programming languages 
is an important part of this process
