(My) Background

???

 I want to talk a bit about where I've started from, because I think it might be useful to understand my perspective, and why I'm interested in doing these things.

I discovered an interest in public health and statistics.

## Background: PhD

.pull-left.large[

I started a PhD in statistics at QUT, under (now distinguished) Professor Kerrie Mengersen, Looking at people's health over time.

- There were several things that I noticed:
  - There were equations, but not as many clear-cut, black and white answers
  
---

## Background: PhD

.pull-left.large[

- Data is really messy
- Missing values are frustrating
- How to Explore data?

]

.pull-right[
```{r explorer}
include_graphics("imgs/explorer.jpg")
```

## Background: PhD - But in psych

.pull-left.large[
- Focus on experiment design
- No focus on exploring data
- Exploring data felt...wrong?
- But it was so critical.

## (My personal) motivation

.large[
- A lot of research in new statistical methods - imputation, inference, prediction
- Not much research on how we explore our data, and the methods that we use to do this.

- I became very interested in how we explore our data - exploratory data analysis.

> The incentive structures of academic statistics still signal that mathematical statistics and the creation of new models and inferential procedures are more valuable than work related to data manipulation, visualisation, and programming. This is reflected in the content of for-credit courses, qualifying exams, and standards for funding and promotion.... It can be very difficult to  present modern data scientific work as impactful scholarly activity, when the system still  defines that primarily as theory and methodology papers.

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan

---

> The basic practices of modularity, testing, version control, packaging, 
and interface design are not mere niceties. They determine whether data scientific 
products can actually be trusted and built upon, like a proof in mathematics

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan

---

>  Users often remark on the ease of  manipulating data with dplyr and it is natural to wonder if perhaps the task itself is trivial.  We claim it is not. Many probability challenges become dramatically easier, once you strike  upon the “right” notation. In both cases, what feels like a matter of notation or syntax is  really a more about exploiting the “right” abstraction.

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan

---

>  It doesn’t matter how good a theoretical solution is, unless there are 
practical tools that implement it. We must also recognise that humans are an essential part 
of the data science process and study how they can interact with the computer most 
effectively. Finding useful abstractions and exposing them through programming languages 
is an important part of this process

-- Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan
