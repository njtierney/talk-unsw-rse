Main arguments of the talk:

- We need software to do research
- Writing research software is a research contribution
- Research software is critically under-funded and not acknowledged. 
- We will continue to lose software developers if they are not acknowledged.
- We must fund and acknowledge software
- What does a research software engineer do?
- The history of research software in academia
- What I do in a day to day role
- What Academia, and you, can do to help

I'll discuss why we need to consider software as academic output,
what a research software engineer does, how I work in a team of researchers, 
and some of the practices I have put in place to maintain reproducibility.

- Functions allow you to abstract complexity so you can individually reason with them

- Assembly --> C --> R --> ggplot

# Abstraction of complexity: similarities between software and maths

--

> Users often remark on the ease of  manipulating data with dplyr and it is natural to wonder if perhaps the task itself is trivial.  We claim it is not. Many probability challenges become dramatically easier, once you **strike  upon the "right" notation**. In both cases, what feels like a matter of notation or syntax is really more about **exploiting the "right" abstraction**.

-- Jenny Bryan & Hadley Wickham  [Data Science: A Three Ring Circus or a Big Tent?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07349.pdf)

This means that it is not just statistical models, but things like dplyr, ggplot

"Unmasking the theta method" (Rob Hyndman & Baki Billah)

> The "Theta method" of forecasting performed particularly well in the M3-
competition and is therefore of interest to forecast practitioners. The original description
of the method given by Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos (2000) involves **several pages**
of algebraic manipulation. We show that the method can be **expressed much more simply** and that the forecasts obtained are equivalent to simple exponential smoothing with drift.

["The origins of SageMath - I am leaving academia to build a company"](https://wstein.org/talks/2016-06-sage-bp/bp.pdf)

- 1991-93: CS Undergrad
- 1997-99: Hecke + interpreter in C++
- 1998: Kohel: Introduced me to both "open source" and
Magma, and said "too bad you have to write an interpreter"...
- 1999-2004: wrote a lot of Magma code (3 Sydney visits), and tried
to convert everyone I met to using Magma.
- 2004: Problems: Magma is closed source, closed development model, expensive; authorship issues
- 2005: created SageMath
- 2016: Left academia to work full time on Sage

## Jack Poulson

> Hi William,


> I am sitting on an offer from Google and am increasingly frustrated by 
continual evidence that **it is more valuable to publish a litany of
computational papers with no source code than to do the thankless task of
developing a niche open source library**. Deep mathematical software is
not appreciated by either the mathematicians or the public.
I had been on the fence about accepting the offer, and this conversation
led to me making the difficult decision.

# "The Astropy problem" ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03159.pdf))

> "[Astropy is] a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy packages." 

--

> For **five years** this project has been managed, written, and operated as a grassroots, self-organized, **almost entirely volunteer effort** while the software is used by the majority of the astronomical community. 

--

> Despite this, the project has always been and remains to this day **effectively unfunded** . Further, contributors receive **little or no formal recognition** for creating and supporting what is now critical software. 

---
# Could grant bodies fund Astropy? 

--

>  ..."the NSF hasn't funded software development for many years now, yet software continues to be written, so...?" 

--

> "[The NSF] would consider funding software, but only once it has reached the point where it's very mature and has a large number of users." 

--

> These opinions reflect a gross misunderstanding of the amount of time, effort, and expertise it takes to develop software, let alone specialized, scientific software.

---
# OK, but how important is astropy?

--

> ... All NASA mission pipelines... [such as the]... venerable Hubble Space Telescope to the upcoming [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope], use Astropy.

## What happens if you don't fund software

websites to securely pass credit card and other sensitive information
over the Internet

> ...the project continued to be informally managed by a
**small handful** of volunteers. 

--

> ... a Google engineer named Neel Mehta stumbled upon a
major flaw in OpenSSL's software...

---
## What happens if you don't fund software


> That bug, nicknamed Heartbleed, had been included in a 2011
update. **It had gone unnoticed for years**. Heartbleed could allow any
sophisticated hacker to capture secure information being passed to
vulnerable web servers, including passwords, credit card information,
and other sensitive data.

--

> The mystery is not that a few overworked volunteers missed this bug; the mystery is why it hasn't happened more often."

## Research software engineer vs Software Engineer

**Researcher**

- Create statistical model of malaria for given region

**Software engineer**: 

- Take existing code base, and productionise in containers to run on the web

--

**Research software engineer**: 

- Identify abstractions, create software that lets researchers write code focussing on the models

# RSEs are everywhere!

- A lot of people have been doing this for a long time
- It isn't necessarily new,
- But providing a name gives us something to rally behind
- The model "career" doesn't have a lot of evidence yet
- We still need **credit**

# Getting credit for software

- Citations are one form of credit
- Google scholar now picks up R packages on CRAN `r knitr::include_graphics("imgs/gscholar-naniar.png")`
- Reference R monthly R package downloads with a badge: [![CRAN Downloads Each
Month](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/naniar)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=naniar)
- From a university/grant writing/job application perspective:
  - Papers (unfortunately) generally count for more beans more than software

**Monash University** has recently started crediting statistical software!

# Publishing software as a paper

Statistical methods:

- Create a new method
- Write code to implement the new method
- Ensure code is easy to use for other people
- Write documentation for the software
- Write tests to ensure the software works
- Write a paper about the new method, which links the paper to the method, to the software
- The reviewers review the paper
  - They typically do not review the software or code

# Publishing software as a paper: some issues

You are writing **many times**:

1. **Write** the method
2. **Write** the code
3. **Iterate** on the code interface
4. **Write** the tests
5. **Write** Documentation
6. **Write** a **paper**

Not guaranteed your code is reviewed

# Publishing software as a paper: JOSS

Journal of Open Source Software

- Write the code, tests, documentation
- Provide a short 1-2 page abstract.
- The code gets reviewed
- Changes made
- Paper gets accepted
- DOI minted
- Your software is now citable!
- It is free!

The paper provides a link to the software. It means the person can write
software and not need to write an entire large paper.

# What can you do? How can we help sustain this?

- Research money for maintenance of existing software
- Seed funding for new software ideas
- Are you a reviewers? On grant committees? Heads of school?
- Talk about the importance of software
- **Count** software when reviewing applications and grants
- **cite** software when you use it in your research!
- Consider hiring RSEs!

it is valuable. I feel that I hear far too many people say, "oh yes, software is 
super valuable", and then that's it - show us that it is valuable in the same
way that people at Monash do. As much as early career researchers like me can
try and give talks like this, we can only impart so much change.

# Take homes

- We need software to do research
- Writing research software is a research contribution
- Research software is critically underfunded and now acknowledged. 
- If we don't acknowledge and support it, we will lose people
- We need to think about how we fund and support those who write software
- RSEs are one path to helping enable and facilitate research impact
- We all need to work together to acknowledge software

# What does academia value?

> The incentive structures of academic statistics still signal that mathematical statistics and the creation of new models and inferential procedures are more valuable than work related to data manipulation, visualisation, and programming. This is reflected in the content of for-credit courses, qualifying exams, and standards for funding and promotion.... It can be very difficult to  present modern data scientific work as impactful scholarly activity, when the system still  defines that primarily as theory and methodology papers.

-- Jenny Bryan & Hadley Wickham

> The basic practices of modularity, testing, version control, packaging, and interface design are not mere niceties. They determine whether data scientific  products can actually be trusted and built upon, like a proof in mathematics

-- Jenny Bryan & Hadley Wickham


>  It doesn't matter how good a theoretical solution is, unless there are 
practical tools that implement it. We must also recognise that humans are an essential part 
of the data science process and study how they can interact with the computer most 
effectively. Finding useful abstractions and exposing them through programming languages 
is an important part of this process

-- Jenny Bryan & Hadley Wickham

# Having RSEs in your team

- Proactive vs Reactive research software
  - Proactive: designs code that can be maintaed easily, for 10 years, is documented well, is tested, is maintainable
  - Reactive: taking existing code and cleaning it up so it can be used for other use cases
- More haste less speed: do it well so you can do it quickly
- Examples of the types of RSE projects
  - What sort of skillset they need, and how it contributes to reserach impacrt
- How would having an RSE inprove the impact of the work?
