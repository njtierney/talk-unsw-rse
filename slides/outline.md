# We need software to do research

- What software do people use in research?
- Has anyone written software for their research and released it into the wild?
- Could you do research without software?
- We need software to do research!
- High profile examples
  - Black hole example from Python
  - COVID graphics from Casey Briggs
  - COVID modelling for Australian government

# Writing research software is a research contribution

- Software is a legitimate form of research controbution
- Functions are tools to help us manage complexity
- Functions allow you to abstract complexity so you can individually reason with them
- Fundamentally this is what software helps us to do
  - MAchine code --> Assembly --> FORTRAN --> C --> R --> ggplot
  - We don't care how the square root happens, just that it does
- Abstraction of complexity - similarities between software and maths
  - 1,000,000 vs 1000000 vs 10^6^
  - Unmasking theta method paper
  - *Your favourite notation example?
  - notation example from Hadley and Jenny
- This means that it is not just statistical models, but things like dplyr, ggplot

# BUT research software is critically underfunded and now acknowledged. We continue to lose people

- We need to think about how we fund and support those who write/maintain software
- Sad example stories
  - Creator of NumPY and SciPY - used these to get tenure track, was rejected
  - * do you know people who have been promoted for software?
- Getting credit
  - citing software via papers
  - issues with writing code, tests, docs, THEN a paper
  - JSS is good, but hard to write these papers + wait time is long
  - JOSS provides an alternative where people review the code, an the papper is short
  - rOpenSci stats peer review is another exciting example
- There needs to be jobs for people focussing on writing software as their primary output
- This leads into the need for RSEs
- Otherwise we lose people
  - where do they go? Industry?
  - Maayyybe some people develop software at google and facebook
  - Do we really want those really talented coders and maths/stats people to not train
    the next generation? Is it bad that people develop at facebook / google and not at university?
- Happy example of people being promoted for software
  - FireDrake
  - LEAN
- How do you fund research software? Astropy example of where this is difficult


# SO we must fund these people and acknowledge software

- What dsoes a reseaexh software engineer do?
- PI shaped researcher
- RSEs acan make research more producictive
- Proactive vs Reactive research software
  - Proactive: designs code that can be maintaed easily, for 10 years, is documented well, is tested, is maintainable
  - Reactive: taking existing code and cleaning it up so it can be used for other use cases
- More haste less speed: do it well so you can do it quickly
- Examples of the types of RSE projects
  - What sort of skillset they need, and how it contributes to reserach impacrt
- How to train an RSE (not just an army of PhD students)
- How would having an RSE inprove the impact of the work?
- How do you hire more RSEs in your work?
