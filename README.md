# Recognising research software in academia

A talk about research software engineering in academia

# Abstract

We need software to do our research. Many researchers write software which
implements new methodologies, statistical models, or graphics. Without
 software, research would not have nearly the same impact or utility. 
Despite the obvious impact of software, we are still working out how to adequately 
acknowledge research software in academia, and how to provide rewarding career 
paths for those who want to write research software as academic output. 
The relatively new field of research software engineering can help address this. 
A research  software engineer combines professional software expertise with an 
understanding of research. I work as a research software 
engineer in academia, and I wanted to explain how this role fits into academia. 
Specifically, I'll discuss why we need to consider software as academic output,
what a research software engineer does, how I work in a team of researchers, 
and some of the practices I have put in place to maintain reproducibility.

# Take home messages 

- We need software to do research
- Writing research software is a research contribution
- Research software is critically underfunded and now acknowledged. 
- If we don't acknowledge and support it, we will lose people
- We need to think about how we fund and support those who write software
- RSEs are one path to helping enable and facilitate research impact
- We all need to work together to acknowledge software

# Bio

Dr. Nicholas Tierney (PhD. Statistics, BPsySci (Honours)) is a Lecturer in Business Analytics and Statistics at Monash University, working with Professors
[Dianne Cook](http://dicook.org/) and [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/). His research aims to improve data analysis
workflow, and make data analysis more accessible. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to
accompany each research idea. Mostly recently, Nick's work is focussing on exploring longitudinal data ([brolgar](http://brolgar.njtierney.com/)), and improving how we share data alongside research ( [ddd](https://github.com/karthik/ddd)). Other work has focussed on exploring data
with the R package [visdat](http://visdat.njtierney.com/), and on creating analysis principles and tools
to simplify working with, exploring, and modelling missing data with the
package [naniar](http://naniar.njtierney.com/). Nick has experience working with decision trees ([treezy](http://treezy.njtierney.com/)),
optimisation ([maxcovr](http://maxcovr.njtierney.com/)), Bayesian Data Analysis, and MCMC diagnostics ([mmcc](http://mmcc.njtierney.com/).

Nick is a member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) collective, which works to make science
open using R, has been the lead organiser for the rOpenSci ozunconf
events from 2016-2018 ([2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/)), and co-hosts the rstats podcast ["Credibly
Curious"](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious) with [Dr. Saskia Freytag](https://careers.amsi.org.au/saskia/). Outside of research, Nick likes to
hike, rockclimb, make coffee, bake sourdough, (eventually) knit a hat, take photos, and explore new hobbies.
